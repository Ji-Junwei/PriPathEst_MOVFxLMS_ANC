## Overview:
This paper proposes an **improved Minimum Output Variance Filtered Reference LMS (MOV-FxLMS)** algorithm to address output saturation in Active Noise Control (ANC) systems. The focus lies on developing a **time-varying penalty factor estimation method** that enhances the adaptability and stability of noise control, particularly when the disturbance environment changes.

## Key Contributions:
1. **Optimal Time-Varying Penalty Factor**:  
   - A new method estimates the penalty factor dynamically based on real-time variations of noise disturbances, avoiding reliance on fixed or pre-determined values.  
   - The approach improves system performance and prevents instability due to amplifier output saturation.

2. **Improved MOV-FxLMS Algorithm**:  
   - Simplifies computations by avoiding redundant dummy control filters and reduces storage requirements.  
   - Avoids errors caused by unrelated interferences at the error sensor.

3. **Numerical Simulations and Real-World Testing**:  
   - Validated through numerical simulations and **real-time experiments** using a noise air duct.  
   - Results show effectiveness in handling **broadband noise, tonal noise, and varying real-world disturbances**, outperforming conventional methods.
